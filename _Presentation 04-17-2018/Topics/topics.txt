  @ Not everyone know unicorns are actually a myth, some people ACTUALLY believe they exist for a long 
period of time which is kind of crazy though o.O




Theory:

  
  @ A GAME THEORY!
  
  @ There are many kinds of theories e.g:
    
    # Game theories - story and stuff,
    
    # Scientific Theories - just like Einstein's relativity paper
    
    # Theories about unexplained stories (mysteries) - Like Bermuda's triangle
  
@ Theories try to tell what could've happened but its not certain though




Prediction:

 
  @ The Simpsons is kind of crazy with their 'predictions'
  
  @ There are some kinds of predictions too! e.g:
    
    # Accurate predictions (not a real term though) - e.g: Math, Physics, Chemistry etc.. which tries to 
predict events and things about other things using math and ACTUAL logic to find reasonable results
   
    # Foolish predictions (also not a real term) - e.g: People trying to predict the future. idk how do 
people not realize that humans are not THAT good at predicting the future...
    
    # Everyday predictions (also... not a real term) - e.g: 'so, i am going on a trip next week, so i 
will plan stuff out. i am planning on going to Minnesota, so it will be VERY COLD probably, so i am going 
to bring more clothing.', basically PLANNING.
  
  @ I predict that this slide is over.
