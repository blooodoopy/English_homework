My topic: 
  Japanese Language

1. Most people think: 
  You need to be a genius 
  to learn japanese

2. Most people forget:
  Japanese people go to school 
  for over 9 years and they 
  just don't know Everything.

3. What to remember: 
  Japanese people WON'T 
  expect you (a foreigner)
  to memorize ALL kanji

My topic: 
  MEMES

1. Most people think:
  That memes are weird 
  and that they don't make sense

2. Most people forget:
  well, THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF MEMES
  and that's what makes it funny

3. What to remember: 
  Memes are just dumb and silly 
  because it is funny. 
  it should not make sense,
  it should be funny, that's all.
